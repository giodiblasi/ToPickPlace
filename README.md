# ToPickPlace :construction: Work In Progress :construction:
This is my Pet Project. It is a project where I can experiment with new tecnologies and methodologies

ToPickPlace assigns seats considering the guests interests. 

## The idea
The user should be able to:
1. create an event
2. draw a seats map 
2. register attendees
3. select the topics in which they are interested
4. obtain the best seat assignment topic-based to increase the communication between attendees.

## Project Components
The project is consists of three main components
- [ ] ToPickPlaceGUI: Single Page Application
- [ ] ToPickPlaceAPI: WebAPI to handle the events
- [x] ToPickPlace Planner: a service to to assign seats based on a genetic algorithm
